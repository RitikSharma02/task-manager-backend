Part 1: Mandatory Backend API (Node.js + TypeScript)
(Must be completed for both tracks)
The API must use Node.js, TypeScript, and an SQL Database (with Prisma/TypeORM) to
serve data securely.
1. User Security (Authentication)
 Implement Login, Registration, and Logout.
 Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for security:
o Access Token (short-lived) for accessing protected routes.
o Refresh Token (long-lived) to securely get a new Access Token when the old
one expires.
 Hash passwords using bcrypt before storing them.
o Required Endpoints: /auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/refresh,
/auth/logout.
2. Task Management (CRUD)
 Implement all required operations for tasks. Tasks must belong to the logged-in user.
 The main task list endpoint (GET /tasks) must include pagination (loading tasks in
batches), filtering (by status), and searching (by title).
o Required Endpoints: /tasks (GET/POST), /tasks/:id
(GET/PATCH/DELETE), /tasks/:id/toggle.
3. Technical Requirements
 Use TypeScript throughout.
 Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like Prisma or TypeORM.
 Implement proper validation and clear error handling with standard HTTP status
codes (e.g., 400, 401, 404)
